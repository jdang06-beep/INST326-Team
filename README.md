## Domain Focus and Problem Statement
**Domain:** Information Science â€“ Media Review Management

**Problem Statement:** Managing large collections of media reviews manually is inefficient. Our library solves key problems such as:
- Identifying the most-reviewed items
- Searching reviews by reviewer or tags
- Aggregating ratings and review statistics
- Exporting and importing review datasets
- Recommending similar titles for users
